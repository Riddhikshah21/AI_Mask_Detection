# **Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  

This project focuses on building an AI model to detect mask-wearing and categorize the type of mask using **Python** and popular machine learning libraries such as **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**. The model was trained and evaluated on relevant datasets and achieved **73.4% accuracy** on the validation data.

## **Overview**
This project aims to develop a robust model for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask and classifying mask types (e.g., surgical masks, N95 masks). The model leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image classification tasks. It is especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, where enforcing mask-wearing is essential for public safety.

## **Features**
- Detects if a person is wearing a mask or not.
- Categorizes different types of masks (e.g., N95, surgical masks).
- Trained on a dataset of labeled mask and no-mask images.
- Achieves **73.4% accuracy** on the validation dataset.
- Uses **PyTorch** for model creation and training.
